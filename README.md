# KoreanSpellChecker
A simple spell checker for the Korean language.  The first step the program does is break the characters apart.  It then adds characters, removes characters, replaces characters, and swaps adjacent characters, and then reforms the character again.  Finally, it loads a dictionary of Korean words and tests the candidate words it has created against the dictionary and returns the possible corrections.
